            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS the <hi>Conception</hi> and <hi>Birth</hi> of the following Discourse was truly owing to the pious Motion and Request of some <hi>Young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> from a Principle (I hope) of unfeigned Zeal for God, and the good of Souls; so it is <hi>their</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, backt by many others, which hath encourag'd and produc'd it's <hi>publick appearance</hi> in the World. Whether God will make that use of it, by <hi>turning</hi> any of <hi>the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Wisdom of the just,</hi> which may answer their Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and my Intention, I am not able to foresee, but am very well
<pb facs="tcp:152925:3"/>assur'd, that it neither will nor can effectually serve such a purpose as that is, any further than <hi>He</hi> is pleased to direct, and set it home upon the hearts of the Readers.</p>
            <p>It is therefore, with an Eye to God'simplored Influence and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, that I have now made this <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> particular Address to such as may be reckon'd in the <hi>Youthful State</hi> and period of Life; the general design both of this and the former, is the same; for as that perswaded and prest a timely <hi>Opposition to the Devil,</hi> this does in like manner sollicite an early <hi>Resignation to God.</hi> Some <hi>Variety</hi> there is in the <hi>Seed,</hi> (and 'tis fit that there should be, for the avoiding of <hi>Vain</hi> and needless <hi>Repetitions,</hi> which may be a fault in <hi>Preaching,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 6.7.</note> as well as in <hi>Prayer</hi>) and there was a <hi>Difference</hi> also in the <hi>Season of Sowing;</hi> it having been suggested to me, that probably a <hi>New-Years-Day</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:152925:3"/>might give some peculiar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for the doing of a greater good; which is my only End.</p>
            <p>The renewing of such Discourses cannot be condemned as superfluous, as long as the <hi>Age</hi> hath so manifest need of them; and tho' want of the wished Success from what hath been already done, be apt to fill all well-affected minds with uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thoughts, yet this should not deter or restrain from future Attempts, for then our <hi>whole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry</hi> might be laid aside, and we might (perhaps with as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) say, as the <hi>lamenting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> did,<note place="margin">Jer. 9.20.</note>
               <hi>We will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his Name.</hi> Divine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience andGoodness, not only in <hi>bearing,</hi> but in <hi>dealing long</hi> with many refractory Sinners, is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a Pattern to us, and the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> may very <hi>justly</hi> be oblig'd to do what their <hi>Great Master</hi> freely
<pb facs="tcp:152925:4"/>condescends to do. If <hi>God speaketh once,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 33.14.</note>
               <hi>yea twice, to man who perceiveth it not,</hi> as it gives us occasion to admire the riches of his <hi>Grace,</hi> so it intimates how little cause we have to repine at the (Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosperous) performance of our own <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have nothing further to signifie to the Reader of this plain Sermon, but that he will find it entirely <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical;</hi> which I mention not, as if I thought that <hi>Doctrinal Subjects</hi> were not proper to be handled, or perus'd, (for undoubtedly <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the <hi>Faith,</hi> have a very useful Tendency to true Holiness of <hi>Life</hi>) but because it is more becoming my Meanness to leave those Subjects to abler Pens. It is exceeding deplorable, that we are fallen into a time wherein the anciently-acknowledged <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals</hi> must be defended, that
<pb facs="tcp:152925:4"/>those mouths of <hi>Socinian</hi> Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my may be stopt, which have been open'd very wide of late; and that better Instructions than those of the <hi>Cracovian Catechism</hi> may be provided for our <hi>English Youth,</hi> among whom the wretched taint seems to be too far spread. But the setting up of <hi>corrupted Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> in defiance to Scripture-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, is the Spring of these Evils; and therefore I have here propos'd and recommended a Surer <hi>Unerring Guide,</hi> who is able to preserve from such Delusions, as well as from all Æ²ngodliness.</p>

            <p>THIS Chapter contains se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Instances of God's marvellous mercy in the earnest Invitation of a very sinful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Repentance; no People could <hi>need more</hi> to be stirr'd up to this Duty, than the <hi>Jews;</hi> nor yet could any <hi>deserve less</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in the performance of it. Every place which they could look to, put them in mind
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152925:6"/>of their Defilements; <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ver. </seg>2</label> so that as their hearts had foolishly <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked after their Eyes,</hi> their Eyes might now justly <hi>affect their Hearts.</hi> But yet to quicken them the more, God manifests his Goodness <hi>in Correcting them with Judgment,</hi> and sends his Rod to make them hearken to his Word; <hi>Therefore the showers have been withholden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 3. C. 5.24, 25.</note>
               <hi>and there hath been no latter rain;</hi> which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned not only here, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards again. Hereupon God <hi>expostulates</hi> with them in the words of the Text, <hi>Wilt thou not from this time,</hi> &amp;c.?</p>
            <p>In which words we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these Two things, God's way and manner of Address to this People, and the Language which he teaches them to speak.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of God's Address to them; <hi>Wilt thou not,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis put in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152925:6"/>form of a Question, which is the most <hi>Pathetical</hi> arguing, and very frequently used by God in Scripture.<note place="margin">C. 13.27.</note> So in another part of this Prophecy, <hi>Wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be?</hi> This is a more direct <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> to the Conscience of the Sinner, than any other general Methods of perswasion; 'tis a more powerful urging of the Sinner to answer to God's call, or to give a Reason why he does not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Language</hi> which God teaches them to speak, as he bids <hi>Israel</hi> to <hi>take with them words,</hi> and then tells them what they should say, <hi>Take away all iniquity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 14.2.</note>
               <hi>and receive us graciously;</hi> so here, he puts them upon <hi>Crying</hi> to him, and instructs them what they should cry, <hi>My Father, Thou art the Guide of my Youth.</hi> Here is a <hi>double relation</hi> to God, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152925:7"/>they are taught to claim, the relation of a <hi>Father,</hi> and of a <hi>Guide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">C. 31.9.</note>
               <hi>My Father.</hi> God owns himself to be <hi>a Father to Israel,</hi> and he was desirous that they should acknowledge him as such also. They had given this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to another, even to sensless Idols,<note place="margin">C. 2.27.</note>
               <hi>Saying to a Stock, thou art my Father;</hi> but now God soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites their return to their Duty; as afterwards in this Chapter, <hi>I said, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ver. </seg>19</label> Thou shalt call me, My Father:</hi> which indeed they had the highest Reason and greatest Obligation to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Thou art the Guide of my Youth.</hi> This Clause may have a <hi>Twofold reference;</hi> Either, 1. To that <hi>conjugal relation</hi> which God had taken them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with himself; God styling himself <hi>their Husband,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 54.5.</note> and the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152925:7"/>Husband in Scripture being ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,<note place="margin">Prov. 2.17.</note> the <hi>Guide of the Woman's Youth.</hi> Or, 2. To his eminent <hi>Providential Conduct</hi> of them, when they were <hi>first formed</hi> to be his People. The time of their coming up out of the <hi>Land of Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 2:15.</note> is often set forth by the <hi>day of their Youth;</hi> and then it was, that God <hi>led them forth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 15.13.</note>
               <hi>and guided them by his strength,</hi> both through the Sea, and in the Desart, till he brought them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may suffice for the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words, as they carry in them a particular respect to the <hi>Jews.</hi> My present design and work is to accommodate and improve them to another purpose. The <hi>days</hi> wherein we live, are extremely <hi>Evil;</hi> but yet we have a sad and doleful Prospect of the <hi>next Age</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming <hi>worse,</hi> if God do not by

               <hi>First,</hi> What is implyed in the <hi>chusing</hi> of God as our <hi>Guide.</hi> Here <hi>Three</hi> things should be open'd a little; what it suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; wherein it consists; and what are the natural Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Effects of it.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:152925:9"/>
            <p> First, What is <hi>supposed</hi> to the making choice of God as our Guide?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> A <hi>Deep sense</hi> of the Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishness, Falseness, Weakness, and Unruliness of <hi>our own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. We must be seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't of the <hi>Foolishness</hi> of our own Spirits. No man in the World resolvedly chuses the Guidance of God, till he hath a due apprehension of this.<note place="margin">Prov. 22.15.</note>
               <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> tells us, and woful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience backs it, <hi>That Foolishness is bound in the heart of a Child.</hi> It is <hi>bound,</hi> in a double Sense; so as to be rooted and <hi>fastned</hi> there, and yet so as to be hid and <hi>concealed</hi> too. Not but that there are too many <hi>open Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries</hi> of it by its <hi>fruits</hi> to others; and nevertheless the <hi>thing it self</hi> remains secret and unperceived to the persons
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152925:9"/>themselves. Tho' we be <hi>really</hi> Fools, yet we are hardly brought to <hi>believe</hi> we are so, but are still <hi>Wise in our own Conceits.</hi> This is that which confirms and <hi>binds</hi> our Misery upon us; for unless we <hi>see</hi> our Folly, we shall never take the right course which the Text prescribes to <hi>cure</hi> it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We must be convinc'd like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of the <hi>Falseness</hi> of our own Spirits. The Prophet warns us of <hi>putting Confidence in a Guide;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mic. 7.5.</note> which is especially applicable to the <hi>Heart</hi> it self. This is so <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful</hi> and treacherous, that none can perfectly <hi>know</hi> it but God. We our selves cannot imagine or suspect how bad it is; they who have presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously <hi>trusted</hi> their own hearts, have always found them to be a great deal worse than they ever <hi>though</hi> them to be. It is most unquestionably true, that no one
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152925:10"/>ever expected <hi>any good</hi> from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but that he hath been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed and deceiv'd <hi>therein.</hi> It is of great use to us, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and remember this; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we shall continue Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident still, and the Conduct of God will be rejected. Men will not remove themselves <hi>out of their own hands,</hi> except they are apprehensive of being <hi>betray'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We must be also convinc'd of the <hi>Weakness</hi> of our own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.30.</note>
               <hi>How weak is they heart, saith the Lord God?</hi> How unable to withstand any small <hi>Temptation,</hi> or to perform any acceptable <hi>Service?</hi> How unable to bear up against it's own <hi>Corruptions,</hi> or to hold out in the exercise of <hi>Grace?</hi> How unable to prevent the <hi>inrodes</hi> of the Devil, or to forbear <hi>running forth</hi> to pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Objects? What a <hi>Spirit of infirmity</hi> is it possest and <hi>bowed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152925:10"/>down</hi> with? How wretchedly feeble does it appear to be, upon the least <hi>Tryal</hi> of it's strength? This should be known and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered by us, or else we shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy our selves by <hi>leaning to our own arm,</hi> as well as our own <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;</hi> for we shall never make unfeigned Application to God, so long aswe fancy that we are strong enough without him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We must be further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the <hi>Æ²nruliness</hi> of our own Spirits. The Scripture does not compare us in vain to the most irregular and <hi>untamed</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; to a <hi>Wild Asses colt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 11.12. Jer. 2.24.</note> and to a <hi>Wila Ass that is accustomed to the Wilderness.</hi> We naturally <hi>break all Yokes,</hi> and <hi>burst all bonds;</hi> are impatient of just restraint, and frowardly pursue our own sinful Inclinations, how mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous soever they be. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152925:11"/>Ministers, Relatives, Friends, cannot <hi>Rule</hi> us, nor we our selves.<note place="margin">Prov. 16.32.</note> It is much easier to <hi>take a City,</hi> and conquer a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea to carry our Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arms through the World, than to <hi>rule our Spirits;</hi> the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Self-Government</hi> is <hi>but a Notion,</hi> and impossible to be put in Practice, till we come out of our state of Nature.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Wherein does the chusing of God for our Guide, <hi>consist?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> In the <hi>committing of our selves</hi> to his Wisdom, Fidelity, Power, and Authority.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It includes a committing of our selves to the infinite <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of God, to be taught and counsell'd by him; so did <hi>David; shew me</hi> (says he) <hi>thy ways,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 25.4.</note>
               <hi>Oh Lord, teach me thy paths.</hi> This is the proper work of a Guide, to <hi>direct</hi> the Ignorant Traveller
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152925:11"/>in a strange Land, and unknown Countrey. Such is our Case du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>time of our Sojourning</hi> here in this World; and it is the work of the <hi>only wise God,</hi> to <hi>guide our feet, and direct our steps for us,</hi> which he will do if we sincerely resign our selves to him. That which undoes us, is not God's <hi>unwillingness to instruct us,</hi> but our own <hi>unteachableness;</hi> there is a <hi>Voice behind us,</hi> but we <hi>refuse to hearken,</hi> and this <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts our way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It includes a committing of our selves to the Fidelity of God, without any jealousie or distrust of it. God is faithful in his ordering and disposing of us; and this holy <hi>David</hi> was perswaded of, when he put up that Prayer;<note place="margin">Psal. 25.5.</note>
               <hi>Lead me in thy truth, and teach me.</hi> We are to <hi>assure our own hearts,</hi> that 'tis impossible to walk in a <hi>way which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152925:12"/>is not good,</hi> if we <hi>walk after the Lord;</hi> that if we <hi>follow God fully,</hi> we can never follow him to our disadvantage. No man chuses such a Guide, as he thinks will carry him <hi>out of his Road,</hi> or <hi>into Danger.</hi> All such unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving fears, must therefore be banish'd from our hearts, with reference to God, that we may be entirely and chearfully given up to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a committing of our selves to the <hi>Power</hi> of God for our Security and <hi>Protection,</hi> and for our Assistance and <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</hi> This is one part of the Office of a Guide, to <hi>guard</hi> those that are under his Care, and likewise to <hi>keep</hi> them <hi>from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> This is intimated by that passage of the Prophet;<note place="margin">Isa. 51.18.</note>
               <hi>There is none to guide her among all the Sons whom she hath brought forth, neither is there any that takes her
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152925:12"/>by the hand,</hi> &amp;c. Now this is one of the things which God performs for us, and which we are humbly to depend upon him for.<note place="margin">Psal. 17.5.</note>
               <hi>Hold up my goings</hi> (says <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>) <hi>in thy paths, that my Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps slip not.</hi> So he dealt with his <hi>Israel</hi> of old, when he <hi>led them through the deep,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 63.13.</note>
               <hi>as an Horse in the Wilderness, that they should not stumble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a committing of our selves to the Supream <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of God,<note place="margin">Isa. 63.13.</note> to be sway'd and ruled by him. Guidance and Government go together; they seem to be Equivalent terms,<note place="margin">Prov. 6.7.</note>
               <hi>Having no Guide, Overseer or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</hi> The Governours of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are called their <hi>Leaders;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 3.12.</note> and therefore 'tis but an empty Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to make as if we were willing to be led by God, when we oppose the setting up of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> within us, and living
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152925:13"/>in a state of Subjection to him. We do not heartily Consent to the <hi>Conduct</hi> of God, unless we agree to be under his <hi>Dominion.</hi> So that if we deal truly in this Case, we must look upon him as our Holy <hi>Soveraign,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119.172.</note> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that <hi>all his Commandments are Righteousness,</hi> as the Holy Ghost affirms them to be.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What are the proper <hi>Consequences</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God to be our Guide?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It will be seen by the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> which we bear to the Spirit and Word, to spiritual and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Fathers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A strict regard to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit,</hi> this is styled in Scripture,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1, 4. Galat. 25.16, 5.</note>
               <hi>walking after the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>walking in the Spirit.</hi> The Enquiry therefore will be, how we carry our selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Spirit of God? When he <hi>strives with us,</hi> whether we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152925:13"/>yield to him, or strive against him? When he would <hi>keep us back</hi> from sin, whether we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist and forbear, or hold our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and go on notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? When he <hi>stirs us up</hi> to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whether we omit or delay it, or whether we set about it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly with all our might? When we feel a Divine <hi>impulse</hi> in our selves, are we wrought upon, influenc'd and determin'd by it, or not? do we <hi>gratifie</hi> the Spirit of God by a ready Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,<note place="margin">Joh. 16.13. Rom. 8.14.</note> or do we <hi>grieve</hi> him by a sullen resistance? According as we can answer hereunto, God is or is not our real Guide, for it is <hi>by his Spirit</hi> that he <hi>leads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A due attendance to the <hi>light of the Word;</hi> for here we have a written Copy of the mind of God, and stated Rules given us to walk by. We are not to look for sudden and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152925:14"/>Revelations to direct us in the Course of obedience, but to eye this Authentick and setled discovery of the Divine Will. The <hi>young man</hi> is bid to <hi>cleanse his way, by taking heed to it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Word.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119.9.</note> And <hi>David</hi> prays in the same Psalm, that <hi>his steps might be order'd in this Word.</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ver. </seg>133</label> Now we should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine our selves, how we stand affected towards the Word, and what reverence and observance we pay to it; Do we consult the Scripture <hi>more,</hi> or <hi>less</hi> than <hi>flesh and blood?</hi> Do we study it in order to a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical acquaintance, or not? Does it constantly <hi>dwell in us,</hi> and is it carefully <hi>laid before us,</hi> or do we neglect it, and forget it?</p>
            <p n="3">3. A just respect to your <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structors in Christ,</hi> especially to <hi>spiritual Fathers.</hi> They who will not <hi>obey their VVord,</hi> are plainly
<pb facs="tcp:152925:14"/>not under the Guidance of God; for Ministerial Conduct is <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi> to his, and Ministers are called <hi>Shepherds,</hi> because they are under the <hi>chief,</hi> and it is their special Province to <hi>lead the flock.</hi> God does no where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn or countenance fordid <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> to <hi>Roman Priests,</hi> (or any like them) but on the other hand he is as far from allowing or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating the <hi>prophane Contempt</hi> of his own Messengers, that are <hi>Pastors after his heart.</hi> It is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>mocking of God,</hi> to sit under any Gospel Ministry, and not to be aw'd, or govern'd by it. The <hi>teachings of God</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to you by <hi>Men</hi> like your selves; and therefore in <hi>despising them,</hi> you <hi>set him at nought.</hi> When you have chosen one to inspect, <hi>and watch for your Souls,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 13 17.</note> you ought to <hi>submit your selves</hi> to him.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:152925:15"/> 4. Regular obedience to <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parents,</hi> or such as are in their stead to you. It is very <hi>becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to take their Advice in all weighty and eminent Cases; it is <hi>necessary</hi> to receive and perform their Commands in all things lawful; but above all, 'tis most <hi>indispensable Duty</hi> to hearken to their Godly admonitions and perswasions in the Matters of Religion. They who can be <hi>deaf</hi> to these, do evidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and relinquish God from being their Guide; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>stubborn and rebellious Child</hi> hath reason to say, as he in the Parable did,<note place="margin">Luk. 15.18.</note>
               <hi>Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee;</hi> you cannot sin against <hi>them;</hi> but that you sin against <hi>heaven</hi> also. God says by <hi>Solomon, My Son,</hi>

               <hi>hear thou the instruction of thy Father, and forsake not the Law of thy Mother;</hi> from whence
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152925:15"/>'tis manifest that their <hi>instruction</hi> should be as a <hi>Law</hi> to you. Such as <hi>ober their Parents in the Lord,</hi> do indeed obey the Lord in their Parents; and Goid hath intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted himself so much in their Quarrel,<note place="margin">C. 30.17.</note> that he hath threatned disobedient Children with hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Eyes pickt out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by Ravens and Eagles.</hi>

               <hi>The wicked are estranged from the womb, they go astray assoon as they are born.</hi> Our very first Motions are disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Satan <hi>possesses us in the beginning of our way.</hi> We are <hi>turned aside</hi> by <hi>youthful lusts</hi> which are bred within, before we step forth upon the publick Stage.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152925:27"/>them up out of the house of bondage.</hi> Therefore do you, that call your selves <hi>Christians,</hi> turn this day, the <hi>first of your Year,</hi> into a <hi>spiritual Festival,</hi> by consecrating your selves to God, your Deliverer from <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) If you do so, you will make this day <hi>so much the more remarkable.</hi> It will be the first day of a <hi>New Life</hi> to you, as well as a <hi>New Year.</hi> You who have been <hi>dead</hi> for so many years, will this day <hi>begin to live,</hi> partake of a Divine <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and a gracious <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> This will vastly out-shine the day of your natural <hi>Birth;</hi> for then you were <hi>born in sin,</hi> and a <hi>Child of wrath;</hi> but now you will be <hi>in Christ,</hi> and a <hi>New Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:152925:28"/> (4.) Hereby you will make all your <hi>following days</hi> truly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and <hi>illustrious</hi> also. You may <hi>henceforward</hi> write <hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> for your Motto, and <hi>date</hi> the sure enjoyment of God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable presence with you. As when the <hi>Jews</hi> laid the <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Lord's Temple, he tells them,<note place="margin">Hagg. 2.18, 19.</note>
               <hi>From this day will I bless you;</hi> so you may <hi>reckon</hi> from this day, that throughout all the <hi>ensuing year,</hi> or years of your life, God will accompany you, provide for you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himself about you, as he does for his own <hi>Children,</hi> and the members of his Family. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this day taken into the <hi>hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold of God,</hi> it shall be <hi>well</hi> with you at all times hereafter; whether you <hi>outlive</hi> this year which you have now <hi>begun,</hi> or not, you may have peace and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152925:28"/>satisfaction unspeakable; for <hi>both worlds are yours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To you who are <hi>elder per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> that have past the time of Youth, and attained to <hi>riper Years.</hi> It is yet <hi>more necessary</hi> for you to lay hold of <hi>this time</hi> for a resolved choice of God, and cleaving to him. If you do not with the <hi>conclusion</hi> of the <hi>old Year, put off the Old man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Colos. 3.9.</note>
               <hi>with his deeds,</hi> you are of all others the most without excuse. Think with your selves,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) How <hi>many opportunities</hi> you have already slipt, and therefore how much it behoves you to slip <hi>no more.</hi> You have <hi>enjoyed multitudes</hi> of seasons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what others have done, and 'tis very dismal to consider, that hitherto you have <hi>improved none.</hi> God have waited <hi>longer</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:152925:29"/>to be gracious to you, than he can be supposed to have done, with reference to younger per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; Christ hath stood knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>longer</hi> at your doors, and therefore he will take it <hi>worse</hi> from you than from any, if after such <hi>continued</hi> repulses, you do not <hi>now</hi> admit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) You have greater cause than others, even <hi>this day,</hi> to alter your course, because you are most apparently nearer your <hi>last day.</hi> The more <hi>such</hi> days you have seen, the less likely it is that you should survive long enough to see <hi>another.</hi> It may be some of you are not only insensibly <hi>going to your long home,</hi> but in great measure are sensibly <hi>gone</hi> towards it. 'Tis possible that some may (as we are wont to say) have <hi>one foot
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152925:29"/>in the grave,</hi> and have not yet <hi>walkt one step with God.</hi> If you do not <hi>think on your ways, and turn your feet now,</hi> even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to natural probability, there are but a few <hi>steps betwixt you and Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Those few, who <hi>while they are yet young</hi> (as was said of <hi>Josiah</hi>) <hi>begin to seek after God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chr. 34.3.</note>
               <hi>will rise up in judgment and condemn you.</hi> Their examples do now <hi>upbraid</hi> and shame you; and therefore, if you felt any thing of <hi>just Emulation</hi> in your on Breasts, and were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive what a <hi>foul Disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> it is to be <hi>outstript,</hi> and exceeded by them that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of years, are <hi>far behind you,</hi> you would resolve this day to be the Lord's. Mis-spend not one <hi>minute of future time,</hi> as you have done what <hi>is past,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:152925:30"/>when some of your <hi>Juniors</hi> are such commendable Presidents in <hi>laying out</hi> the <hi>same</hi> Months and Years, which are now <hi>lost</hi> to you, to great advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A few Words to them that have already made such a choice of God, whether Young or Old. I would advise and perswade both to these two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Bless God</hi> for the <hi>inclining</hi> and influencing of your Hearts to chuse him. Offer to him a <hi>New Thanksgiving</hi> upon that account this day; and do not <hi>sacrifice the praise</hi> of it to <hi>your selves. It is God that hath wrought in you to will</hi> such a Self-surrender; for by Nature you <hi>were</hi> as much averse to it, as any can <hi>now remain.</hi> Make your acknowledgments to him
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152925:30"/>for it, as for one of the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Mercies</hi> which he could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow, or you receive; a Mercy which you can never sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>admire</hi> or <hi>celebrate,</hi> tho you should spend <hi>every Year,</hi> and <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day,</hi> in thinking and speaking of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Renew</hi> the Solemn Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of your selves to God <hi>at this time.</hi> Tho you have done it <hi>heretofore,</hi> do it now <hi>again;</hi> for it cannot be done <hi>too firmly,</hi> and therefore neither can it be done <hi>too frequently.</hi> This is a Day (with many) of <hi>sending gifts one to another,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to those that have <hi>formerly</hi> partaken of their Kindness on the <hi>same occasion.</hi> Why should not we then <hi>repeat the giving of our selves to the Lord</hi> in a peculiar manner, as oft as this time <hi>returns</hi> upon us? It was the Laudable Custom of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:152925:31"/>Worthy and Famous Mr. <hi>Robert Fleming,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Author of the <hi>[Fulfilling of the Scripture]</hi> and other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> to set apart this day for such a purpose, near Fifty years successively. Let us <hi>go and do likewise,</hi> that we may be able, as long as we live, to look back still up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>Day,</hi> in all our Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations for our <hi>Stability and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>
